# üì¶ü§ó Welcome to the semantic-release community

`semantic-release` is much more than just code. At the end of the day we try to make people‚Äôs lifes easier, that means having great documentation, tutorials and empathy for trouble that users of semantic-release run into as well as their ideas to improve the project.

## Using semantic-release means joining a team :)

`semantic-release` is an [Free and Open Source Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) run entirely by volunteers. If you run into any problems we are welcoming your bug reports, but please keep in mind to be actively kind and patient with us. We ask you to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

As a user of `semantic-release`, you become part of the team. You can help us to help you by providing as much information as possible with your bug report or your feature request.

### A perfect bug report

Before submitting a bug report, take a breath and make sure to remove all offensive language, especially if you are very frustarted :)

In order for us to act on your bug report, we need to be able to reproduce it first. The easier you make that for us, the more likely we can help you out in a timely manner. If you run into a problem, try to narrow down the cause of the bug. Ideally create a dedicated repository on which we can collaborate together until we find out the cause.

Once the bug is confrmed, we welcome your pull request to resolve it.

### A perfect feature request

Open Source is ["free as in puppy"](https://opensource.com/article/17/2/hidden-costs-free-software). That means that adding a new feature, no matter how small, means we have to maintain it until the end of time :) Removing features is highly controversial, so we are very careful before adding new ones.

Please create an issue to discuss your feauter request before sending a pull request. Make sure to mention your use case(s) to the issue, not only the solution. That allows us to come find workarounds that might make the feature obsolete, or come up with a better solution for your problem.

### Ask "How do I ..." questions on Stack Overflow

GitHub issues are not well suited for general questions on how to use it, [ask on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/semantic-release) instead. That way others can benefit from it, too. We are monitorng questions tagged with `semantic-release`.

## Contributo to semantic-release

There are many ways that you can contribute to semantic-release

1. ‚≠êÔ∏è Star [our main repository](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) on GitHub. That helps others to find out about our community
2. Use `semantic-release`, let us know how you like it. Saying thanks goes a long way üíñ Share it with your friends on Twitter & Co
3. Help us triage issues and pull requests. That means add helpful labels, ask for more information, close duplicates, etc.
4. Find open issues to work on. Look for the `help wanted` and `good first issue` labels. All issues on this welcome repository with the `available` label are ready for you to work on, just claim it with a comment and you are good to go :)
5. Review open pull requests. Don't worry about asking "stupid" questions, there is no such thing. An additional pair of eyes is always welcome. 
6. Write tutorials and blog posts about your experience to help others to get started with `semantic-release`. Screencasts are great, too.
7. Give talks! Let us know if you plan to submit a talk, we are happy to help you with the submission and slides with your talk.

After we have seen you contributing several times we will invite you to the Contributors team on the semantic-release GitHub organisation.

## Become a maintainer

We will probably approach you before you'll even have a chance to ask if you can join the maintainer team :) If you keep contributing by helping out other users, pull request reviews, submitting pull requests yourself, we will notice and ask you to join the team :) If you agree to join, we will invite you to the Maintainers team on the semantic-release GitHub organisation.

The top priority for all maintainers it to make and keep `semantic-release` a welcoming project to everyone. Our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) is not only a document, it's our our responsibility to live by it and hold everyone, including ourselves, accountable for our actions.

As maintainers we want `semantic-release` to be a vital community. Finding new contirbutors, help users to help themselves, recognise contributions (especially beyond just code) is our responsibility.

If there is a conflict of direction in the community, the maintainers follow a [Consensus-seeking decision-making process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making). If no consensus can be found, the maintainers hold a vote.

Maintainers are expected to join regular meetings to discuss the current state of the project and upcoming priorities.

Current maintainers are

## Alumni

People come, people go, especially in Open Source. Interests shift, life happens and once active contributors and maintainers move on. We appreciate their previous contributions and make them part of our Contributors/Maintainers Alumni teams on the semantic-release organisation. These teams no longer have write access to our repositories as a security measurement.
